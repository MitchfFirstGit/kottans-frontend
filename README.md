It was awesome. I want to improve my existing code with OOP. Do - Learn - Improve -- it's a great method!
## Object Oriented JS
In this task, I've learned a lot about Object Oriented JS and I've created my first game in JavaScript - Frogger. Also, I now know about a very interesting  site [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), there are a lot of interesting tasks. It was hard but also great.
